    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  RavL is provided as a free app and is intended for use as is. It offers a single in-app purchase for purposes of an upgrade that removes ads as described below.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information. The app does not collect or share your information with
                  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> 
				<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> 
			<div>
				<p>
                    The app does use third-party services that may collect
                    information used to identify you, should you engage with them. The third-party service providers used
                    by the app are:
                  </p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li><li>Google's <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a> advertising platform</li><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></ul>

				<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
                  Therefore, I advise you to review the
                  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                  privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                  services.
                </p> 
				<p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p> 
			<div>
				<p>
                    The app is not oriented toward anyone under the age of 13.
                    The app does not collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age, as it does not collect personal information from any users. Engaging with the third-party sites described above will expose any user to the privacy policies of those sites. 
                  </p>
			  </div> <!----> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update this Privacy Policy from
                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes.
                </p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2022-10-25</p>
